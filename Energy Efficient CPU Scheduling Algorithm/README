This project provides an Energy-Efficient CPU Scheduling Simulator made with Streamlit to analyze and illustrate different CPU scheduling strategies. Round Robin (RR), Priority Preemptive, Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF), and an Advanced Energy-Aware algorithm that balances load across processes and maximizes energy and performance are all supported. Users can upload custom workload files, modify settings like the Round Robin quantum and energy-aware weights (a, b, and c), and compare algorithm performance.

In order to guarantee balanced CPU utilization, the simulator computes important metrics including average turnaround time, average waiting time, and total energy consumption. It also keeps an eye on load distribution. Gantt charts are a visual representation of scheduling behavior. With the aid of this interactive program, researchers and students may better comprehend the principles of CPU scheduling, evaluate trade-offs between energy, performance, and load, and create efficient, well-balanced, and energy-efficient scheduling plans for contemporary computer systems.
